# Test Framework

A React-based prototyping environment for experimenting with UI components.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ installed

### Setup and Run

1. **Install dependencies**:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Start the development server**:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

3. **Open your browser** to <http://localhost:5174/>

That's it! The app will automatically refresh when you make changes to files in the `src/` directory.
